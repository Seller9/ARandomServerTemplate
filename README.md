# A Random Server Template
Notes on A Random Server (My Discord Template)

Please note that any messages I add to channels (specifically read-only channels) will be placed in the Messages folder.

Notes on this page are ordered in:

[**Categories**]()

**Roles**

**Bots**

**Clubs**

................................................................


## Categories

Uncategorised: There is only #club-selection in this area. This is where users can select clubs (see Clubs heading) by using YAGPDB.xyz (once set up) (see Bots heading).

Category - STAFF STUFF: This category is for managing users which are breaking the rules or solving issues. The different staff rooms are different rooms for different problems (eg. multiple staff managing multiple issues). The third staff room has a voice channel too, in case it is needed.

Category - IMPORTANT INFO: Important info is just a bunch of read-only notes. #read-me has server information, #updates is an update list, where you as the owner sum up updates you have done to the server, #other-notes are miscellaneous notes you may want to post, and #system-messages is for joining and leaving messages (set up with UnbelievaBoat) and server boost messages.

Category - GENERAL: This is where people mainly talk. the #new-people-chat is for new people who do not have the @Member roles (roles mentioned below). #a-random-channel is the basic text channel where those with @Member chat. #bots are for the use of any bots you add to the server. I have Groovy and Simple Poll in my server to use. The voice channels are for members. There are 3 channels as, in the event of having a large server, people may want to talk to specific people.

Category - MUSIC: Think of this like a school club, you do music stuff together, or just talk about music. 

Category - CLUB CREATION: like a school club, they don't come out of nowhere. People can request to make a club (see the Roles heading below). #club-creation-template is a basic template of clubs (read Server Messages folder on GitHub)

Category - HIDDEN: If you want to hide stuff from people, like notes or something, use this. People with @Moderator or above can read and write to this channel.

Category - BOT CONFIG: This is for configuring UnbelievaBoat and YAGPDB.xyz. I also use BetterAntispam (very rarely) so that is why there is a channel for that.



## Roles

@Bot Permissions: This gives all bots (and anyone you give this to) FULL PERMISSIONS of the server. Bots can be given certain permissions via the automaticly created role of the bot's name.

@Owner: Basically full permissions with your name at the top of the members list!

@Talking to Staff: This role removes a lot of access to all channels, and can not talk in any but the staff rooms (although hidden). 
**NOTE**: This role requires all other roles to be removed (specifically @Member) to work, along with adding one of the @in Staff Room 1-3 roles.

@in Staff Room 1-3: This role allows any member to talk in the staff room of that number, including the voice channel of staff room 3. READ NOTE ABOVE FOR IMPORTANT INFORMATION.

@Administrator: Allows higher permissions, although does not give all permissions.

@Moderator: Less permissions than @Administrator, but still can moderate the server.

@Club - Music: Allows access to talk in #music (Category - MUSIC). This is set up with YAGPDB.xyz on my server so people can join and leave whenever they want.

@Member: Allows authorised access to your server. By default, new people can only talk in the #new-people-chat with Discord's Slowmode set to minimum. When they are a @Member, they cannot speak in #new-people-chat, but will gain access to other channels, specifically everything in the GENERAL category.

The next in the list are all the bot roles.

@Club Creation: This allows people to look at #club-creation-template and talk in #club-creation to set up a club.

@Muted: Makes a user muted, so they cannot talk.
**NOTE**: This role requires all other roles to be removed (specifically @Member) to work.

@new role: I am not sure what this does but you can have a look, I guess?

@everyone: Standard permissions for new members. Includes read access to all in the IMPORTANT INFO category, as well as messaging in #new-people-chat.



## Bots
I use UnbelievaBoat and YAGPDB.xyz to help my server:

UnbelievaBoat: This is used to manage joining/leaving in channel #system-messages (Category - IMPORTANT INFO) and deleting/editing messages in #deleted/#edited (Category - UNBELIEVABOAT), respectively.
  
 YAGPDB.xyz: This is used to assign automatic roles (for clubs).



## Clubs

Clubs are what I use to (try to) entertain people. I've made a club system which allows people to join and make clubs. The club I have created (Music) is a general music club readable by any @Member and writeable by any @Club - Music. The misic club is designed for people to share their love of music by making it, sharing favourite songs or whatever music-related things they want to talk about.

People can ask to make a club, in which you (or somebody who can assign roles) give them @Club Creation and talk with them in #club-creation
